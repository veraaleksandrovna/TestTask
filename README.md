**TEST TASK: **
The autotest must do the following:
1.Open your browser and expand it to full screen (BrowserService.cs)
2.Go to following url (DropDownPage.cs 17 line)
3.Find country drop-down element (DropDownListTest.cs 21 line)
4.Make sure that the number of countries in the country drop-down list is correct (249) (DropDownListTest.cs 27 line)
5.Close the browser (BaseTest.cs 20 line)

**MY NOTES:**
1. Test framework was written based on PageObject pattern
2. OOP principles are present
3. Assertions was written with FluentAssertions
